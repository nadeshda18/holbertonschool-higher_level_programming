Requirements:

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.\*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 - c 'print(**import**("my_module").**doc**)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 - c 'print(**import**("my_module").MyClass.**doc**)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 - c 'print(**import**("my_module").my_function.**doc**)' and python3 - c 'print(**import**("my_module").MyClass.my_function.**doc**)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it's a real sentence explaining what's the purpose of the module, class or method(the length of it will be verified)
